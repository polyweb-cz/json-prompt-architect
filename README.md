## What is this?

JSON Prompt Architect is a visual tool that helps you create strict JSON schemas and forms to guide Artificial Intelligence (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) to output structured data exactly how you need it.

Instead of writing complex JSON manually, you build the structure visually, set validation rules (like minimum/maximum length), and then fill out a user-friendly form to generate the final JSON prompt.

## Key Features

- **🎨 Visual Editor:** Build complex JSON structures with nested sections and key-value pairs using drag-and-drop.
- **✅ Robust Validation:** Enforce rules like minimum and maximum character length to ensure AI outputs (or your inputs) meet specific criteria.
- **📝 Form Mode:** Automatically generates a clean input form based on your structure. Perfect for reusing prompts with different data.
- **🤖 AI Integration:** Open your constructed prompt directly in **ChatGPT** or **Google Gemini** with a single click.
- **🔗 Easy Sharing:** Share your templates with others via a simple URL. The entire structure and data are stored in the link itself (no server required).
- **🔒 Privacy First:** Runs entirely in your browser. No data is sent to our servers.

## How to Use

1.  **Edit Mode:** Define your structure. Add text fields, long text areas, or organize them into sections. Set limits (e.g., "Max 64 chars") to keep data concise.
2.  **Use Mode:** Switch tabs to see the generated form. Fill in the values. The tool validates your input in real-time.
3.  **Output:** Copy the resulting valid JSON or click **"Open in ChatGPT"** to start a conversation with the AI using your structured data immediately.
